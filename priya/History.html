<p class="history"> <h1>History:</h1>Cardamom has been used in flavorings and food over centuries. During the Middle Ages, cardamom dominated the trade industry. 
The Arab states played a significant role in the trade of Indian spices, including cardamom. 
It is now ranked the third most expensive spice following saffron and vanilla.
Cardamom production began in ancient times, and has been referred to in ancient Sanskrit texts as ela.
The Babylonians and Assyrians used the spice early on, and trade in cardamom opened up along land routes and by the interlinked Persian 
Gulf route controlled from Dilmun as early as the third millennium BCE Early Bronze Age, into western Asia and the Mediterranean world.
The ancient Greeks thought highly of cardamom, and the Greek physicians Dioscorides and Hippocrates wrote about its therapeutic properties, 
identifying it as a digestive aid. Due to demand in ancient Greece and Rome, the cardamom trade developed into a handsome luxury business; 
cardamom was one of the spices eligible for import tax in Alexandria in 126 CE. In medieval times, Venice became the principal importer of cardamom into the west, 
along with pepper, cloves and cinnamon, which was traded with merchants from the Levant with salt and meat products.
In China, Amomum was an important part of the economy during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). In 1150, 
the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi noted that cardamom was being imported to Aden, in Yemen, from India and China
The Portuguese became involved in the trade in the 16th century, and the industry gained wide-scale European interest in the 19th century.</p>

<p class="pro"><h1>Production:</h1>
In 2022, world production of cardamom (included with nutmeg and mace for reporting to the United Nations) was 138,888 tonnes, led by India, Indonesia and Guatemala, which together accounted for 85% of the total (table).

Production practices
According to Nair (2011), in the years when India achieves a good crop, it is still less productive than Guatemala.
 Other notable producers include Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Much production of cardamom in India is cultivated on private property or in areas the government leases out to farmers. 
Traditionally, small plots of land within the forests (called eld-kandies) where the wild or acclimatised plant existed are cleared during February and March. 
Brushwood is cut and burned, and the roots of powerful weeds are torn up to free the soil. 
Soon after clearing, cardamom plants spring up. After two years the cardamom plants may have eight-to-ten leaves and reach 30 cm (1 ft) in height. 
In the third year, they may be 120 cm (4 ft) in height.[20] In the following May or June the ground is again weeded, and by September to November a light crop is obtained. 
In the fourth year, weeding again occurs, and if the cardamoms grow less than 180 cm (6 ft) apart a few are transplanted to new positions. 
The plants bear for three or four years; and historically the life of each plantation was about eight or nine years. 
In Malabar the seasons run a little later than in Mysore, and – according to some reports – a full crop may be obtained in the third year. 
Cardamoms grown above 600 m (2,000 ft) elevation are considered to be of higher quality than those grown below that altitude.
Plants may be raised from seed or by division of the rhizome. In about a year, the seedlings reach about 30 cm (1 ft) in length, and are ready for transplantation. 
The flowering season is April to May, and after swelling in August and September, by the first half of October usually attain 
the desired degree of ripening. The crop is accordingly gathered in October and November, and in exceptionally moist weather, 
the harvest protracts into December. At the time of harvesting, the scapes or shoots bearing the clusters of fruits are broken off close to the stems and placed in baskets lined with fresh leaves. 
The fruits are spread out on carefully prepared floors, sometimes covered with mats, and are then exposed to the sun. Four or five days of careful drying and bleaching in the sun is usually enough. In rainy weather, drying with artificial heat is necessary, though the fruits suffer greatly in colour; they are consequently sometimes bleached with steam and sulphurous vapour or with ritha nuts.[20]
The industry is highly labour-intensive, each hectare requiring considerable maintenance throughout the year. 
Production constraints include recurring climate vagaries, the absence of regular re-plantation, 
and ecological conditions associated with deforestation.</p>

<p class="we"><h1>Uses</h1>
Wikibooks Cookbook has a recipe/module onCardamom
Both forms of cardamom are used as flavorings and cooking spices in both food and drink. 
E. cardamomum (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a masticatory, or is smoked.[14]

<h3>Food and beverage</h3>:
spice in foods, cardamom-flavoured tea, also flavoured with cinnamon, is consumed as a hot beverage
Cardamom has a strong taste, with an aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a more smoky 
though not bitter – aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint.
Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight,[15] but little is needed to impart flavor. 
It is best stored in the pod, as exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavor. 
Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. 
For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals 1+1⁄2 teaspoons (7.4 ml) of ground cardamom.[citation needed]
